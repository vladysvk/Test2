                Computer hardware refers to the physical components of a computer system, including the parts that you can touch and see. It includes devices like the motherboard, processor (CPU), memory (RAM), storage devices, and peripherals like keyboards, monitors, and printers. Computer hardware is essential for running software and performing tasks that make computing possible. This website will provide information about various hardware components and their role in the overall computing process.Computer hardware engineers research, design, develop, and test computer systems and components such as processors, circuit boards, memory devices, networks, and routers.
